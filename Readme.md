<p>Generally, the following methods can be used to find a necessary row in the GridView:<br />

<a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraGridViewsBaseColumnView_LocateByValuetopic">LocateByValue</a></p><p>However, there can be a situation when you need to perform a custom algorithm for finding a necessary row. For example, if you want to find all rows whose values contain a specific substring. In this case, you need to traverse through all rows manually, as described in the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/A1245">How to traverse grid rows in their visible order</a> Knowledge Base article.</p><p>This example demonstrates this approach in action.</p>
